# Log Yo' Workouts 
#### Using Node Code & SQL DB

Project inspired by homework week 11 for Code Bootcamp; however, instead of storing a faux-product catalog, this app stores workout history (and retrieves/updates it).

## Your Turn: Setup Instructions

> "I thought those workouts were cardio before I seeded this database"
> - you in 10 minutes

```
git clone https://github.com/krosenk729/Node-SQL-Workout-Logger.git
npm install

cd server/database
node schema.js
(pause and wait)

node seed.js 
(pause and go workout)
```

## Up & Running: Pun Intended

You have three choices: 
1. Log a workout (spin, run or lift)
2. Report on workouts (yeah buddy)
3. Update an exisiting workout (only do this if you know the workout_id)

```
cd server/
node cli.js
```
